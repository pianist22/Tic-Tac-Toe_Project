#Tic-Tac-Toe Project Description:

Welcome to our exciting Tic-Tac-Toe game project developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! This classic game offers a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for an immersive gaming experience. Here's a detailed overview of the project:

1. **Fancy UI:** Our Tic-Tac-Toe game boasts a sleek and modern user interface, designed to enhance your gaming pleasure. The layout is intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless gaming experience for players of all ages.

2. **Current Player Tab:** At the top of the game board, there's a dynamic "Current Player" tab that indicates whose turn it is to play. It starts with Player X and alternates between Player X and Player O throughout the game.

3. **Game Grid:** The centerpiece of the game is the grid, which displays the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This 3x3 grid provides the canvas for players to make their moves and compete for victory. Each cell in the grid represents a potential move.

4. **New Game Button:** Positioned prominently below the game grid is the "New Game" button. This button becomes visible whenever the game concludes, either due to a player winning or the game ending in a tie. Clicking on this button initiates a new game, resetting the board and allowing players to start fresh.

5. **Gameplay Mechanics:** The gameplay follows the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe. Player X begins the game, followed by Player O. Players take turns placing their respective markers (X or O) in empty cells on the grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three markers of the same type. The game continues until one player achieves this goal or until all cells on the grid are filled, resulting in a tie.

6. **Winner Announcement:** When a player wins the game, the "Current Player" tab updates to display the victorious player's name (X or O). This provides instant feedback to the players, allowing them to celebrate their triumph.

7. **Tie Detection:** In the event that the game ends in a tie (i.e., all cells on the grid are filled without either player achieving victory), the "Current Player" tab notifies players that the game has ended in a tie.

Our Tic-Tac-Toe project promises endless hours of fun and excitement for players of all skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or a casual gamer, this game offers a delightful way to test your wits and enjoy some friendly competition. So, gather your friends, sharpen your tactics, and let the games begin!
